Based on the identified sprint themes, generate specific, actionable recommendations.

Themes:
{themes}

For each theme (prioritize Critical/High severity first):
- Provide 2-4 concrete action items
- Ensure actions are SPECIFIC, not vague
- Estimate effort (realistic time estimates)
- Predict impact (based on theme frequency and severity)

Return JSON in this EXACT format:
{{
  "recommendations": [
    {{
      "theme": "string (theme name)",
      "priority": "High|Medium|Low",
      "action_items": [
        {{
          "action": "specific description of what to do",
          "effort_estimate": "2 hours|1 day|3 days|1 week|2 weeks",
          "impact": "high|medium|low",
          "owner_suggestion": "role like 'Scrum Master', 'Tech Lead', 'Team'"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Examples of GOOD recommendations:
✅ "Set up Datadog monitoring for staging environment with alerts for 5xx errors and crashes"
✅ "Create a requirements checklist template in Confluence with mandatory fields before sprint planning"
✅ "Schedule 2 pair programming sessions per sprint (Tuesday and Thursday afternoons) and rotate pairs"
✅ "Add acceptance criteria review step in backlog refinement meetings"

Examples of BAD recommendations (too vague):
❌ "Improve communication" 
❌ "Fix the staging environment"
❌ "Be better at planning"
❌ "Work on team dynamics"

Rules:
- Be as specific as possible
- Include tools/platforms when relevant
- Suggest who should own the action
- Keep effort estimates realistic
- Focus on preventive measures, not just fixes
