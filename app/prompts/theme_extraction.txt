You are analyzing summarized sprint retrospective feedback from {team_size} team members.

Your task:
1. Identify RECURRING themes (mentioned by 2+ people, or 1 person if severity is high)
2. Group similar issues even if worded differently (e.g., "slow deployments" = "long CI times")
3. Categorize each theme: Critical Issue / Moderate Issue / Success / Suggestion
4. Provide evidence from direct quotes

Team Feedback:
{summaries}

Return JSON in this EXACT format:
{{
  "themes": [
    {{
      "name": "string (specific theme name, not generic)",
      "category": "Critical Issue|Moderate Issue|Success|Suggestion",
      "frequency": "X out of Y",
      "percentage": number,
      "impact": "string describing concrete impact on team",
      "quotes": ["actual quote from feedback"],
      "mentioned_by": ["user names or Anonymous"],
      "severity": "high|medium|low"
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules:
- Only include themes mentioned by 2+ people (unless severity is high)
- Be specific with theme names (not "Communication" but "Unclear Requirements from Product Team")
- Impact should describe actual consequences, not just the problem
- Sort by severity (high to low)
- Maximum 10 themes total (focus on most important)

Examples of GOOD theme names:
✅ "Staging Environment Instability"
✅ "Unclear Acceptance Criteria in User Stories"
✅ "Effective Pair Programming Sessions"

Examples of BAD theme names:
❌ "Communication" (too vague)
❌ "Problems" (not specific)
❌ "Issues" (meaningless)
