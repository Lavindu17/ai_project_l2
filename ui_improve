Apple’s UI design is anchored in a small set of core principles (like clarity, deference, depth, hierarchy, harmony, consistency, and accessibility) that you can expand into a practical “12‑principle” checklist for beautiful, clear, and fully accessible interfaces.
​

Core visual philosophy
Clarity first, always

Ensure text is highly legible, icons are precise, and layout creates a clear visual hierarchy so people instantly understand what’s important.
​

Use clean typography, generous whitespace, and unambiguous affordances so users can act with confidence, not guess.
​

Defer to content, not chrome

Let content be the hero and keep decorative UI elements minimal so they never compete with what the user came to see or do.
​

Use subtle bars, translucency, and lightweight controls that guide interaction without drawing unnecessary attention.
​

Use depth for context and focus

Apply layering, blur, and shadows to show what is foreground vs background and where the user currently is in the experience.
​

Reinforce this depth with motion, like views scaling or sliding from predictable origins, to maintain spatial continuity.
​

Establish strong hierarchy

Visually prioritize the primary task and actions using size, weight, and placement so users never wonder “what now?”.
​

Reserve bold color and prominence for primary actions while secondary and destructive actions recede appropriately.
​

System harmony and consistency
Align with platform harmony

Match the look and feel of the OS (rounded corners, dynamic materials, default typography) so the app feels like part of the device, not a foreign object.
​

Reuse system components and patterns so users transfer what they already know from other Apple apps.
​

Respect consistency and conventions

Use standard icons, gestures, and placement (e.g., tab bars at bottom, system back behavior) instead of inventing new patterns for common tasks.
​

Keep behavior consistent across screens and window sizes, even when layouts adapt, so the same action always feels and works the same.
​

Design adaptable, not rigid layouts

Use responsive layouts and constraints so the interface scales gracefully across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and varying window sizes.
​

Maintain the same mental model and hierarchy even as elements reposition for different orientations or display environments.
​

Functionality and usability
Prioritize usability over decoration

Treat visual polish as serving function: every color, icon, and animation must help the user understand or accomplish something.
​

Avoid visual noise and gratuitous effects that add cognitive load without improving comprehension or efficiency.
​

Make interactions obvious and lightweight

Ensure tappable areas are large enough, feedback is immediate, and transitions are smooth so the system feels responsive and “just works.”
​

Use familiar interaction patterns and gestures so people can predict results, reducing errors and the need for instructions.
​

Communicate state and feedback clearly

Clearly show loading, success, errors, and selection states using motion, color, and icons that are easy to interpret at a glance.
​

Avoid ambiguous states; users should always know what is happening and what the system expects from them next.
​

Accessibility and inclusion
Bake in accessibility from the start

Support Dynamic Type, sufficient color contrast, VoiceOver, and accessible hit targets so people of varied abilities can use the product fully.
​

Avoid using color alone to convey meaning, and ensure labels, traits, and order make sense to assistive technologies.
​

Support personalization and inclusion

Allow users to adjust typography, colors, motion, and interaction modes so the interface adapts to their needs and preferences.
​

Design for multiple input and sensory modalities (touch, keyboard, voice, haptics) so no single way of interaction is mandatory.


Colors
Use a limited semantic palette: grayscale backgrounds + one primary accent (like “system blue”) and a few semantic states (success, warning, error) instead of many random brand colors.
​

Prefer system/semantic colors that adapt to light/dark mode (e.g., label, secondaryLabel, systemBackground, systemBlue) so contrast and accessibility stay correct automatically.
​

Maintain high contrast: follow at least ~7:1 ratio for small text and important UI, and never rely on color alone to convey meaning (always pair with text or icons).
​

Concrete accents often used in iOS (approximate RGBA, fine for web prototypes): system blue rgba(0,122,255,1) light and rgba(10,132,255,1) dark; system red rgba(255,59,48,1); system green rgba(52,199,89,1).
​

Corner roundings
Use generous radiuses for controls to get that “friendly” iOS feel; common iOS UI kits use around 10–13 px radius for cards and buttons at 1x scale (e.g., 44–56 px high buttons).
​

Keep radiuses consistent per component type:

Small buttons/chips: 8–10 px

Standard buttons, text fields: 10–12 px

Large cards/panels: 12–16 px
These values scale with your base size, but relationships should stay consistent.
​

Avoid mixed shapes in one view; either mostly rounded rectangles or mostly circular elements, with only truly special items (e.g., avatars) going full circle.
​

For icons specifically, Apple uses an approximate 1:6.4 ratio of corner radius to icon size (e.g., 19 px icon → ~3 px radius), which you can reuse for app-like iconography.
​

Spacing and layout
Base your spacing on an 8‑point grid: paddings and gaps typically in 4/8/12/16/24/32‑point increments; Apple particularly leans on 8, 16, and 32 for core layout rhythm.
​

Use more space around primary content: outer margins larger (e.g., 16–20), inner content paddings smaller (8–12) so key information “breathes” while remaining compact.
​

Respect safe areas: keep text and actionable controls inside platform safe areas and use default OS margins unless you have a clear reason to override them.
​

Handy pattern you can copy for mobile (in points/px at 1x):

Screen horizontal padding: 16

Card internal padding: 16 (top/bottom), 16–20 (left/right)

Vertical gaps: 8 between related items, 16–24 between groups.
​

Fonts and typefaces
Use Apple’s system typefaces when on Apple platforms: SF Pro for UI (sans‑serif) and New York for serif text; download from the official fonts page for design work.
​

SF Pro has text and display optical sizes; use Text for body and small UI labels, Display for large titles/headlines where tighter spacing looks better.
​
​

Never hard‑code single sizes; design with Dynamic Type in mind so labels, titles, and body text scale across accessibility settings.
​

For web/Android equivalents, a near match is:

Use a clean neo‑grotesque sans like Inter, SF Pro (if allowed), or system‑ui stack like -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif.
​

Typography tips (hierarchy + rhythm)
Build a simple, stable hierarchy: e.g.,

Large title: 28–34, semibold

Section title: 20–22, semibold

Body: 15–17, regular

Caption/secondary: 12–13, regular
Keep line heights generous (about 1.3–1.5) to match Apple’s open look.
​

Use weight and size, not random colors, to show hierarchy: darker and larger for primary text, lighter secondaryLabel color and smaller size for metadata.
​

Left‑align almost all body and UI text; center only short labels or titles, and avoid justified text because it hurts readability on narrow screens.
